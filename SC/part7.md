# _Why is code review important

Code review is a great way to keep a team responsible for each other. 

Think of it this way-- You're writing code that satisfies present-you; but you wouldn't throw future-you under the bus, you would _also_ aim to satisfy future-you. 

Well, team members are just like future you! They're all responsible for keeping a stress-minimal codebase, and they all stand to benefit from stress-minimal codebase.
